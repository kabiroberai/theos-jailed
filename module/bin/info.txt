	b. Under "App Services" enable the following services:

$ENT_LIST

	b. For "App ID" choose "$BUNDLE_ID"
	c. Choose the development cert you want associate with this profile (or "select All")

= Installing the provisioning profile on your device using Xcode =
==================================================================
1. In Xcode goto Window / Devices
2. Right-click on your device and choose "Show Provisioning Profiles"
3. Click the + sign to install your new profile. You'll be asked to 
   browse to the .mobileprovision file.

==============================
= Installing the patched app =
==============================
1. Delete any existing copies of the app from your device. 
	Note: You can't install over the top of the real application,
	      so it must be deleted first. This only needs to be done
	      once per patched application.
2. Run "make package install [PROFILE=<mobileprovision | bundle.id>]" to patch and install the .ipa
	Note: If you omit the profile, the script will try to use Xcode's iOS Wildcard App ID
3. Do the following only if the "install" part didn't work
	a. In Xcode goto Window / Devices
	b. Under "Installed Apps" click the + button
	c. Choose the patched .ipa file and cross your fingers
	d. The patched app should appear on your device.
